Actions:
Review the CI/CD pipeline structure, including build and release stages, artifact management, and deployment configurations.
Analyze triggers, approval steps, and rollback processes to ensure alignment with the retail applicationâ€™s requirements.
Evaluate integration with other components, such as testing suites or monitoring tools.
Output:
Detailed documentation of the CI/CD process flows.
Recommendations for optimizing the DevOps pipeline to reduce deployment times or enhance error handling.
3. Java and Spring Boot Development Analysis
Objective: Examine the Java/Spring Boot framework for its impact on application performance and maintainability.
Actions:
Assess the application structure within Spring Boot (e.g., microservices or monolithic) and its impact on modularity.
Review configurations for performance optimization, such as caching, load balancing, and database connectivity.
Analyze how easily the current setup supports continuous delivery, scaling, and automated testing.
Output:
Insights on the strengths and limitations of Java/Spring Boot in this application.
Suggested improvements to enhance performance and maintainability.
4. Service Architecture Analysis
Objective: Define the service interactions, especially focusing on the inter-service communication within the "Service," "Product," "Payment," "Inventory," and "Intern Billing" modules.
Actions:
Map out the service-oriented architecture and analyze communication methods (REST, gRPC, etc.).
Document dependencies and data flow among the services, particularly around critical areas like payments and inventory updates.
Identify any potential bottlenecks or areas where latency might affect performance.
Output:
Visual map of service interactions and data flows.
Recommendations for enhancing inter-service efficiency and robustness.
5. Product Management Process Analysis
Objective: Investigate the processes around product lifecycle management, focusing on alignment with system architecture.
Actions:
Review workflows, tools, and documentation associated with product management.
Determine how product management interacts with other components (e.g., linking inventory to product updates).
Identify gaps or areas where processes could be automated.
Output:
Overview of product management workflows and how they integrate into the application.
Suggestions for process improvements or automation.
6. Database Technology and Flow Analysis
Objective: Understand the database structure, flow of data, and its support for Payment and Inventory.
Actions:
Map out database entities and relationships, especially those critical to payment processing and inventory.
Examine data integrity, backup, and recovery processes.
Evaluate scalability and query optimization settings to handle high traffic.
Output:
Database structure and flow documentation.
Recommendations for enhancing database performance and integrity.
7. Reg Global Series Integration
Objective: Clarify the role and integration of "Reg Global Series" within the infrastructure.
Actions:
Research "Reg Global Series" in context (using existing documentation and stakeholder interviews).
Determine its impact on other components, data flow, or compliance standards.
Output:
Explanation of "Reg Global Series" within the infrastructure.
Recommendations for better integration or optimization if necessary.
8. Environment Management (PPE and Production)
Objective: Evaluate environment setup, focusing on deployment strategies and testing protocols.
Actions:
Review deployment workflows and promotion strategies from PPE to production.
Assess testing protocols in PPE, ensuring they cover all major use cases and edge cases.
Confirm rollback strategies and production monitoring tools.
Output:
Environment setup and deployment strategy documentation.
Recommendations to improve testing, security, or deployment efficiency.
